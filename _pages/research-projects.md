## Research Projects

Overview of my research projects.

### Molecular cloning and functional studies of F-type lectin  
**From roughskin sculpin (*Trachidermus fasciatus*)**  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Shanshan Yu (Marine College, SDU)  
- Conducted gene cloning, sequence analysis, structural prediction, tissue distribution, expression profiling, stimulus‑induced changes, and in‑vitro bioactivity tests  
- **Co‑authored 1 academic paper**

### Application of GAN model integrating evolutionary information in RNA secondary structure prediction  
- **Supervisor:** Brian Parker and Jiayu Wen (John Curtin School of Medical Research, ANU)  
- Integrated conserved RNA structure information into secondary structure prediction using a GAN model

### Identification and analysis of antimicrobial peptide gene of *Rapana venosa*  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Shanshan Yu (Marine College, SDU)  
- Identified and cloned the antimicrobial peptide gene  
- Applied bioinformatics techniques to predict structure and functional domains  
- Utilized MEGA to analyze phylogenetic relationships

### Plant Diversity Survey and Ecology Study of Weihai City  
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Zhao Hong (Marine College, SDU)  
- Conducted field surveys on plant diversity, distribution, and abundance in the mountains of Weihai City  
- Documented over 70 species and prepared more than 50 plant specimens  
- Provided baseline data for plant diversity research and conservation

### Coastal animal diversity study of Golden Beach, Weihai City  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Liu Xu (Marine College, SDU)  
- Collected over 40 marine organism specimens  
- Provided data and theoretical support for the protection of wild marine animal resources and offered references for marine resources research in Weihai City

Hi, I am Ruizhe Wang (王睿哲 in chinese). I have recently completed my master’s degree in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics at the Australian National University, where I gained a solid foundation in both computational methods and biological sciences. During my studies, I became particularly interested in how machine learning techniques can be applied to complex biological problems, especially in understanding the structural configurations of RNA and proteins. 

Although I am still at an early stage of this field, I have been actively self‑studying advanced topics in machine learning and structural bioinformatics to broaden my skills and deepen my understanding. I am genuinely eager to join an academic research environment, learn from experienced researchers, and contribute my effort and curiosity to meaningful scientific work.
